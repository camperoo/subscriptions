subscriptions
=============

No releases yet, this is still a work in progress, but...

Subscriptions is a subscription-billing engine for Ruby on Rails. Think Chargify or Stripe, but as a mountable engine where:

1. you provide your own payment provider
2. you don't have to do any API integration
3. it's open source
4. there are NO FEES
5. it supports multiple groups/tenants
